/**
 * diag-stale-directory.ts — READ-ONLY diagnostic. Writes nothing.
 *
 *   tsx scripts/diag-stale-directory.ts
 *
 * Counts the old-DoW-directory data still live in the system so we can state the
 * cleanup's blast radius HONESTLY before running any --commit reconcile (the API
 * container rejects ad-hoc SQL, so this verb is the supported way to query prod).
 *
 * The counts here use the SAME predicates as the reconcile/repair classifiers, so
 * "wouldSupersede" / "wouldRetire" / "linksToRepair" equal what those jobs will do.
 *
 *   personnel  — people whose ENTIRE provenance is the old DoW spreadsheet
 *                (stanford_dow_directory_jan2026 / stanford_dow_tier1) and who are
 *                absent from the updated directory (dow_directory_rev6_2026_06).
 *   PEs        — program_element rows still tagged stanford_pe_directory_jan2026
 *                (the J-book never re-asserted them), split by "has live signal"
 *                (keep) vs none (retire).
 *   links      — non-superseded people whose pe_primary points at a missing/retired
 *                PE (the link-repair set), and how many of those are human-trusted.
