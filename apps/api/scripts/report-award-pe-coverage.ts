/**
 * report-award-pe-coverage.ts — READ-ONLY diagnostic.
 *
 *   tsx scripts/report-award-pe-coverage.ts
 *
 * Prints federal_award PE/acquisition-program coverage as JSON so we can state
 * the contractor-panel coverage HONESTLY without direct Aurora access (the API
 * container entrypoint rejects ad-hoc SQL, so this verb is the supported way to
 * query live). Writes nothing.
 *
 * Output: total awards, how many carry a DoD acquisition program code, how many
 * have a resolved pe_code (broken down by pe_code_source), how many distinct PEs
 * are reachable through the curated acq-program map, and the top program codes by
 * award count among awards still lacking a PE (so we know which programs to add
 * to the map next for the biggest coverage win).
