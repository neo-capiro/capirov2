/**
 * Domain term expansion for intel matching.
 *
 * Bill subjects, CRS policy areas, and Federal Register topics are stored as full
 * English phrases ("Electronic warfare", "Artificial intelligence"), but lobbyists
 * tag clients with short acronyms ("EW", "AI"). Trigram, whole-word, and embedding
 * matching all miss that acronym↔phrase gap, so before matching we expand a curated,
 * high-precision set of defense/government acronyms to their canonical phrases.
 *
 * Direction is one-way (acronym → phrase): the corpus uses the phrase, so that is the
 * direction that improves recall. The map is intentionally conservative — ambiguous
 * tokens (e.g. "VA", "IT", "ED") are omitted to avoid false expansions. Extend it as
 * new client tags appear.
