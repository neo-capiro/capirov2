/**
 * Pure, dependency-free helpers for assembling the Meri chat request to the
 * Anthropic Messages API: system-prompt content blocks, tool-schema cache
 * breakpoints, and streaming token-usage accounting.
 *
 * Everything here is a pure function so it can be unit-tested under the repo's
 * standard `src/**.spec.ts` jest matcher (jest does NOT scan `scripts/` or
 * `test/`). The orchestrating service (`meri.service.ts`) imports these; keep
 * all I/O, Prisma, and HTTP out of this file.
 *
 * Prompt caching (P0-1): Anthropic caches the request prefix up to and including
 * each `cache_control: { type: 'ephemeral' }` breakpoint. The cacheable prefix
 * order is tools -> system -> messages, so we place breakpoints on (a) the final
 * tool schema and (b) the static system base. Both are byte-identical across
 * turns, so turns 2..N within the 5-minute cache TTL read the prefix from cache
 * (response usage reports `cache_read_input_tokens > 0`) instead of re-encoding
 * it. We deliberately do NOT cache the dynamic system tail (intent guidance +
 * per-tenant context snapshot) or the messages, both of which vary per turn and
 * could otherwise leak tenant-specific content into a long-lived cache prefix.

You can write the overview fields (name, website, description, productDescription, primary contact, sectorTag, issueCodes, uei, cageCode, naicsCodes, pscCodes) AND append facilities (locations: name, address, city, state, ZIP, congressional district, employee count) and capabilities (products/technologies/services the org offers: name, type, description, sector) you find on the client's website — pass them as the facilities[] and capabilities[] arrays (each row is appended, existing rows are never deleted).
