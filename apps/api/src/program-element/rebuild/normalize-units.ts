/**
 * Pure helpers for the value-based PE-mark unit normalizer.
 *
 * Context: program_element_year marks were stored in raw DOLLARS but the app
 * renders MILLIONS. The log-based rebuild (rebuild-years.ts) only repaired fields
 * that had per-field source-value log entries (request + committee marks); the
 * historical enacted/conference values were loaded without per-field logging and
 * stayed in dollars. This normalizer finishes the job on the canonical table
 * directly, keyed off MAGNITUDE rather than the log.
 *
 * Why a magnitude threshold is safe + non-destructive here: every value is either
 * (a) already millions — real marks top out around $1-2B = ~1500, seed fixtures
 * ~600, all well under the threshold — or (b) raw dollars, which for any real PE
 * mark is >= ~$1e7. Nothing legitimate sits near $100,000M ($100B), so any
 * |value| over the threshold is unambiguously dollars and is divided by 1e6.
 * Idempotent: once divided, values fall below the threshold and are never touched
 * again. Fixtures (already millions) are below the threshold, so left alone.
