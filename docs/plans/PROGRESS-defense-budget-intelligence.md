# Defense Budget Intelligence — execution progress

Branch: `feat/defense-budget-intelligence-plan` (off `main` @ 5ca3bcc).
Plan: `docs/plans/2026-06-07-defense-budget-intelligence-gap-analysis-and-execution-plan.md`.
Driver: autonomous overnight run. Each completed step is its own commit; this file is the tracker.

## Working rules
- Each step: read the closest analogous code → implement to convention → verify (typecheck +
  jest/vitest, DB on a scratch DB where needed) → adversarial review → commit. Never break the
  baseline suites.
- **Concurrent work**: a parallel session is editing whitepaper/chat UI files
  (`apps/web/src/components/chat/*`, `WhitePaperEditorPage.tsx`, `theme.css`) in this same working
  tree. Those are left UNTOUCHED and never staged in my commits.
- **Autonomy limits (honest)**: this env has no reliable way to (a) download + pdfplumber-extract
  real congressional PDFs, (b) run `cdk diff`/query prod AWS, (c) call runtime LLMs, or (d) use a
  SAM.gov key. Steps that hinge on those are **scaffolded** (tooling + runbooks + deferred-data
  notes), not faked. Marked SCAFFOLDED below.

## Execution order (value + completability, deps respected)
Code-completable first: 1.2 → 1.4 → 1.3 → 2.1 → 2.4 → 4.1 → 2.2 → 2.3 → 3.2 → 3.4 → 3.5 → 4.2.
Scaffold/partials interleaved: 0.4 (diag+docs), 0.3 / 1.1 / 1.5 (tooling+runbooks), 3.1 / 3.3 (scaffolds).

## Log
- (start) Branched `feat/defense-budget-intelligence-plan` off 5ca3bcc; baseline typecheck clean
  (api+web), jest 715 / vitest 98 green.
- **Concurrent-session collision + worktree pivot**: a parallel session switched the shared
  OneDrive working tree to its own branch (`whitepaper-clean`) mid-task, yanking my checkout. To
  work safely overnight without colliding, I created an **isolated git worktree** for my branch at
  `C:/Users/neoma/capiro-obi` (separate working dir, own node_modules, shared .git). All overnight
  work happens there; the OneDrive tree is left to the other session. My branch retains complete
  Steps 0.1 + 0.2 (verified: resolveReconciliation + budget-reconciliation present).
  NOTE for review/merge: this branch is based on 5ca3bcc (bundles the other session's whitepaper
  backend); if `main` history is rewritten, rebase this branch onto final main before merging.
- **Step 1.2 done** (worktree): API `GET :peCode/projects` + `:peCode/sources` (proof-pack ordered
  R-1→R-2→R-2A→R-3→P-1→P-40, FY desc, page asc) + projectCount/sourceCount on the detail; web
  ProjectsPanel + ProofPackPanel (deep-links `#page=`) wired into the PE page; ContractorsPanel
  named-prime link now appends `#page=`. Tests: proof-pack ordering, controller delegation,
  panel render + deep-link + empty-state. api+web typecheck clean; targeted jest 19 / vitest 9 green.
  Deferred (not in success criteria): FyDetailDrawer per-field open-at-page link — minor follow-up.
- **Step 2.1 backend done** (implemented by a sub-agent in the worktree, then independently
  verified by me): Program / ProgramAlias / PeProgramMatch (global, additive migration w/ pg_trgm
  GIN + functional-unique COALESCE index); `seed-programs.ts` (idempotent, MDAP→Program +
  accepted/mdap_curated matches + aliases); pure `program-match-thresholds.ts` (the §5/§7
  guardrail — fuzzy/usage tiers can NEVER reach 'accepted'); `pe-program-matcher.service.ts`
  (trigram, fuzzy capped <0.90 → candidate/quarantined only) + `match-pe-program.ts`;
  ProgramsService/Controller (`GET /programs`, `/programs/:id`, admin match-queue list + resolve
  w/ AuditLog). Verified: api typecheck clean; 6 suites/81 specs green (incl. table-driven
  thresholds + 0 fuzzy-accept SQL proof); migration applies clean on a fresh scratch DB; seed +
  matcher proofs.
- **Step 2.1 web done** (sub-agent + my verification): web programs-api, ProgramMatchQueuePage
  (capiro_admin review queue: why-shown evidence line + confidence band + status, accept/reject/
  quarantine + AuditLog), ProgramsPanel on the PE profile (accepted + candidate-badged, quarantined
  hidden), thin `GET /program-elements/:peCode/programs` read + controller delegation test, App.tsx
  route. Verified: api+web typecheck clean; FULL suites green (API 99 suites/778, web all pass).
  Deferred (documented): explorer "Programs" search TAB (needs a new /api/explorer/programs facet
  endpoint + panel — risky to the finder); added the `getPrograms`/`useProgramSearch` building block.
- **Step 1.3 code done** (sub-agent + my verification): `ProgramElementBudgetPosition` (global,
  additive migration, natural-key unique, FK→PE cascade + →source_document set-null); pure tested
  `computePbComparison` (new_in_pb/dropped_from_pb, null/zero handling); idempotent
  `upsertBudgetPosition` + column→positions builder; `GET :peCode/positions` + `:peCode/pb-comparison`;
  verify-budget-reconciliation extended to position cycles. Verified: api typecheck clean; 7
  suites/98 specs green; migration applies clean on an independent fresh scratch DB.
  **DATA-PENDING** (built to consume it): FYDP outyears (committed R-1 artifact has no $ columns —
  needs real R-1 PDF re-extraction) + FY2026 prior-PB book (unavailable) → loader writes 0 rows
  today + pb-comparison returns empty until data lands. Headline data criteria deferred by design.
